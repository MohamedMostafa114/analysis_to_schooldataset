# School Dataset Analysis

## Overview
The **School Dataset Analysis** project explores, cleans, and analyzes a dataset containing information about students, their demographics, academic performance, and other school-related attributes.  
The main objective is to uncover patterns, identify factors influencing student outcomes, and provide actionable insights for educators and decision-makers.

---

## Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning** to handle missing, duplicate, or inconsistent records
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify trends and distributions
- Visualize **key insights** using graphs and charts
- Explore **relationships** between variables such as study time, grades, attendance, and parental involvement
- Summarize findings for use in school improvement strategies

## Dataset
> **Note:** Ensure the dataset is placed in the `data/` folder or adjust file paths accordingly in the code.

- **File format**: CSV (`school_dataset.csv`)
- **Key columns** (example):
  - `student_id`
  - `gender`
  - `age`
  - `study_time`
  - `attendance_rate`
  - `final_grade`
  - `parent_education`
  - `school_support`

## Tools & Libraries
This project uses **Python** and the following libraries:
- `pandas` – data loading, cleaning, and manipulation
- `numpy` – numerical operations
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – data visualization
- `scikit-learn` *(optional)* – statistical analysis or predictive modeling
- `jupyter` – running notebooks interactively
